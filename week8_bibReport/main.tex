\section{Source 1}
This source talks about the need to address gaps or needs in the work force that will be solved by automation and increase job loss. Low income workers and students are two groups that are will be hit the hardest by the rise of automation. As new and low income workers are less likely to be hired over a robot that can work longer hours for negligible compensation. The authors coin the term "the future of work" to refer to concepts such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual/Augmented reality. Developments that can potentially negatively impact low income workers. \cite{ED59399720181115}
