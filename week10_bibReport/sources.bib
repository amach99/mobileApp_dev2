abstract="The purpose of this chapter is to determine fundamental differences of transition to Industry 4.0 from previous industrial revolutions. The methodology includes structural and functional analysis, comparative analysis, induction, deduction, formalization, etc. These methods are used for determining similarities with previous industrial revolutions and peculiarities of the future Fourth Industrial Revolution. The authors prove that transition to Industry 4.0 is a new industrial revolution, which is shown by the attributes that are a sign of all industrial revolutions: change of the type of technological mode as a result of mass implementation of accumulated industrial innovations and systemic transformations in industry, which results in deep changes in logistics and manufactured products. At the same time, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is unprecedented and possesses a whole range of peculiarities, as compared to previous industrial revolutions. It envisages full elimination of human from the production system, ensuring absolute automatization of the production process, simultaneous combination of formation of global industrial networks with elimination of negative social consequences, changes the essence of industrial patents, and creates a possibility for quick change of direction of industrial production's specialization.",

Abstract = {Will new technologies cause industries to shed jobs, requiring novel policies to address mass unemployment? Sometimes productivity-enhancing technology increases industry employment instead. In manufacturing, jobs grew along with productivity for a century or more; only later did productivity gains bring declining employment. What changed? The elasticity of demand. Using data over two centuries for US textile, steel and auto industries, this paper shows that automation initially spurred job growth because demand was highly elastic. But demand later became satiated, leading to job losses. A simple model explains why this pattern might be common, suggesting that today's technologies may cause some industries to decline and others to grow. Automation might not cause mass unemployment, but it may well require workers to make disruptive transitions to new industries, requiring new skills and occupations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
