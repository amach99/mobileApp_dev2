HR Employee Analysis app/Company app

My goal is to develop a database that stores employee data to help HR professionals track the progress and predict the performance of employees 
using automated reports.

Prescriptive analytics are currently used in all departments of a business except Human Resources. Finance uses models to predict budgets,
Supply chain specialists use models to predict necessary inventory or the most efficient distribution centers. Human Resources is an outdated department 
that is currently not employing the use of statistics and the latest technology to maximize 
the potential of their workforce. From hiring practices to promotion decisions or even firing an employee,an organization's management can 
use statistically modeled reports from HR to make informed decisions regarding their workforce.

The Human Resources department is an outdated department that is ill equipped to handle the legal hurdles of employment while effectively assisting its employee
to grow and succeed. Currently HR is one of the few departments which have yet to effectively utilize the increase in data exchanged and ease of communication 
between a company and its employees' to help them succeced. I aim to change this with my app and provide HR professionals with a valuable tool that can help 
them manage and stay up to date with their employees' in today's dynamic online workplace.
