\section{Apple Watch new Face ID unlock feature}
This source is directly from apple.com support page and provides details about apples most recent software update to their iPhones. Soon after Apple hyped up its improved face ID security feature, the COVID-19 pandemic forced everyone to start wearing masks and it rendered face I'd useless. In the new update, users who own an apple watch will be able to unlock their iPhones with face ID as the watch provides additional confirmation that the authorized user is the person unlocking the device. A cool new way to utilize wearable technology to increase security on mobile devices \cite{apple_support_2021}.

\section{Airtags}
Apple recently released a new product called AirTags. This product is similar to Tile trackers and allow apple users to place a tracker on their belongings. This product utilizes other devices in its vicinity to notify owners of its location. As mobile technology becomes increasingly popular and more devices are able to connect to the internet, the use of a mesh network where devices communicate with each other to rely information like location can be very effective. As long as the Airtags are in vicinity of other devices, and not lost in a forest or secluded area \cite{apple_2021}.
