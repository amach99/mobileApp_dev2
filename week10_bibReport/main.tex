\section{As Time Goes by: From the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution}
This book discusses how societies and their economies have been impacted by industrial revolutions over time. The term Kondratiev wave is used to describe how industrial-capitalist economies change and how these patterns of change influence long-term fluctuations \cite{freeman2001time}.

\section{The Transition to Industry 4.0}
This source talks about how the current industrial revolution is different from previous industrial revolutions and what are the key differences that make it so peculiar. The authors discuss the full elimination of human intervention from the production operations, to move toward total automation of the production process \cite{Popkova2019}.

\section{How Automation will affect Job Growth/Loss}
This source discusses a trend in job growth/loss sparked by automation. Automation initially spurs job growth because demand is high, however as demand decreases so does the number of jobs. The authors theorize that while automation may not cause mass unemployment, it will definitely cause workers to make serious changes such as transitioning to new occupations \cite{14450544920191001}.
