Abstract = {The "future of work" is an evolving concept with wide-reaching implications for the economy, workforce, education, and society--including workers, business owners, students, and the people who serve them. The impact from these changes brings a sense of urgency to stay a few steps ahead and address systems' gaps and faulty machinery that threaten to put low-income workers and students at a disadvantage. This brief will provide an overview on the changing nature of employment relationships that have implications for low-wage workers. It will also feature recommendations to help education and workforce development practitioners and policymakers address the demands of the future economy, including recommendations for new approaches to business engagement.},
