    Abstract = {Several popular low-level device-to-device techniques, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct, are seen today as enablers for 5G mobile networks, as the communication infrastructure for future Internet of Things systems. However, most of these technologies do not support direct over the-air communication between end users/devices. Opportunistic networks propose the use of delay-tolerant and wireless communication over such technologies, toward routing messages between end users.},
